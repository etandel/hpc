##1) About
This is my code for the classes of Introduction to High Performance Computing
at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).

The dirs are divided in themes (openMP, openMPI, CUDA etc.) and inside them there are the implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem in different methods:

GA -> Genetic Algorithm
SA -> Simulated Annealing

Elias Tandel Barrionovo and Marcelo Neves
