This is my code for the classes of Introduction to High Performance Computing
at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio).

The dirs are divided in themes (openMP, openMPI, CUDA etc.) and inside them there are the implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem in different methods (GA = Genetic Algorithm).
